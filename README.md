# House Price Prediction

This project predicts **house prices** based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other characteristics. It employs **machine learning techniques** to build a robust regression model that provides accurate predictions.

---

## Features

- **Regression Modeling**: Implements machine learning models to predict house prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into the dataset through various plots and graphs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared for model evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries 

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibrahimfadu/House-price.git
   cd House-price
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house-price-prediction.ipynb
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Dataset**:
   - Uses the **California Housing Dataset** available in Scikit-learn.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing values.
   - Encodes categorical variables.
   - Scales features to standardize data.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Trains models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, or others.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Tests the model on unseen data and calculates evaluation metrics.
5. **Prediction**:
   - Provides predictions for new input data.
